# Cambridge-text-generator
Cambridge University said that people can read text with only first letter on the right place, so I made a generator

## Usage
### Build project using cmake
```
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake ..
```
### Make project
```
make
```
### Open `Source-text.txt` file
#### You need to open this file in `build/txt/` dir!!!
You can use whatever you want. In this file you must write what you want to be converted to this silly experimental text.
### Simply run generator
```
./Generator
```
### Done
Your converted text is in `build/txt/Generated-text.txt` file.

## Example text
### Source:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin eu.
### Generated:
Lrome ispmu dloro sti atem, cnoestcteru apidsiicgn etil. Porni eu.
